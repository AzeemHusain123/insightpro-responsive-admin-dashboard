# InsightPro – Responsive Admin Dashboard

## 📘 Project Overview  
**InsightPro** is a fully responsive admin dashboard interface built **entirely with HTML and CSS** (no JavaScript).  
It was developed as a web engineering assignment to demonstrate advanced CSS techniques, including:  
- Responsive grid and flex layouts  
- CSS-only sidebar toggle functionality  
- Dark/light theme switching using CSS variables  
- KPI cards, CSS-only charts, and styled forms  
- A print-optimized stylesheet for clean report output  

---

## ⚙️ Key Features  
- Toggleable sidebar navigation (using `:checked`/checkbox hack)  
- Light and dark themes switched via CSS variables  
- KPI cards showcasing metrics like Sales, Users, Revenue  
- Pure-CSS data visualizations (bar charts, progress charts)  
- Structured, semantic HTML5 layout with `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<aside>`, `<footer>`  
- Print-friendly stylesheet (`print.css`) that reformats the dashboard for printing
